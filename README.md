# Arecibo Website
 This small project was made by Carlos A. Gal√°n De Arce and Cristopher Rosado Miranda for the Web Design Class. We decided to select the town Arecibo to express our grattitude in form of a website. This website contains a summary of the history, memorable places, the shield / flag of the town and mayor along with their 2016-2020 assembly members.
